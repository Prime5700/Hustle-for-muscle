    <h3>Origin & Meaning</h3>

    <p>
      Daoism is a Chinese philosophy and religion, dating back to Lao Tzu (or
      Laozi). It emphasizes living in harmony with Nature, or Tao, and it’s main
      text is the Tao Te Ching, dating back to 6th century B.C. Later on some
      lineages of Taoism were also influenced by Buddhist meditation practices
      brought from India, especially on the 8th century C.E..
      <br /><br />
      The chief characteristic of this type of meditation is the generation,
      transformation, and circulation of inner energy. The purpose is to quieten
      the body and mind, unify body and spirit, find inner peace, and harmonize
      with the Tao. Some styles of Taoist Meditation are specifically focused on
      improving health and giving longevity.

    <h3>How to do it?</h3>
    <p>
      There are several different types of Taoist meditation, and they are
      sometimes classified in three: “insight”, “concentrative”, and
      “visualization”.
      <br />
      <br />
      <strong>Here is a brief overview:</strong>
    </p>
    <!--Starting of unordered list-->
    <div class="ul">
      <ul>
        <li><h4>Emptiness meditation (Zuowang):</h4></li>
        <img src="../Images/emptiness meditation.jpg" class="img" alt="" />
        <p>
          To sit quietly and empty oneself of all mental images (thoughts,
          feelings, and so on), to “forget about everything”, in order to
          experience inner quiet and emptiness. In this state, vital force and
          “spirit” is collected and replenished. This is similar to the
          Confucius discipline of “heart-mind fasting”, and it is regarded as
          “the natural way”. One simply allows all thoughts and sensations arise
          and fall by themselves, without engaging with or “following” any of
          them. If this is found to be too hard and “uninteresting”, the student
          is instructed with other types of meditation, such as visualization
          and Qigong
        </p>
        <br /><br /><br />
        <li><h4>Visualization (Cunxiang):</h4></li>
        <img src="../Images/visualising meditation.jpg" class="img" alt="" />
        <p>
          In meditation, the mind concentrates while the body relaxes; an
          effective position in which to begin visualization. ... When the mind
          is clear and the body is relaxed, you can engage the imagination to
          visualize images and ideas. Meditation and visualization have the
          power to teach and heal.
          <br /><br />

            in relation to one’s own body and self.</i

        <br /><br /><br /><br />
        <li><h4>Breathing meditation (Zhuanqi):</h4></li>
        <img src="../Images/breathing meditation (2).jpg" class="img" alt="" />
        <p>
          To focus on the breath, or “unite mind and qi”. The instruction is
          “focus your vital breath until it is supremely soft”. Sometimes this
          is done by simply quietly observing the breath (similar to Mindfulness
          Meditation in Buddhism);
          <br /><br />
          in other traditions it is by following certain patterns of exhalation
          and inhalation, so that one becomes directly aware of the “dynamisms
          of Heaven and Earth” through ascending and descending breath (a type
          of Qigong, similar to Pranayama in Yoga).
        </p>
        <br /><br /><br /><br />
        <li><h4>Inner Vision (Neiguan):</h4></li>
        <img src="../Images/inner vision meditation.jpg" class="img" alt="" />
        <p>
          visualizing inside one’s body and mind, including the organs, “inner
          deities”, qi (vital force) movements, and thought processes. It’s a
          process of acquainting oneself with the wisdom of nature in your body.
          There are particular instructions for following this practice, and a
          good book or a teacher is required.
        </p>
        <br /><br /><br /><br />
        <li><h4>Internal Alchemy (Neidan):</h4></li>
        <img src="../Images/internal alchemy.jpg" class="img" alt="" />
        <p>
          a complex and esoteric practice of self-transformation utilizing
          visualization, breathing exercises, movement and concentration. Some
          Qigong exercises are simplified forms of internal alchemy practices.
        </p>

    <p>
      Most of these meditations are done seated cross-legged on the floor, with
      spine erect. The eyes are kept half-closed and fixed on the point of the
      nose. Master Liu Sichuan emphasises that, although not easy, ideally one
      should practice by “joining the breath and the mind together”; for those
      that find this too hard, he would recommend focusing on the lower abdomen
      (dantian).

    <p>
      People that are more connected with the body and nature may like to try
      Taoist meditation, and enjoy learning a bit about the philosophy behind
      it. Or if you are into martial arts or Tai Chi, this might be of your
      interest. However, Taoist centers and teachers are not as easy to find as
      Buddhist and Yoga ones, so it might be a challenge to follow through.

    <h3>Origin & Meaning</h3>
    <p>
      Qigong (also spelled chi kung, or chi gung) is a Chinese word that means
      “life energy cultivation”, and is a body-mind exercise for health,
      meditation, and martial arts training. It typically involves slow body
      movement, inner focus, and regulated breathing. Traditionally it was
      practiced and taught in secrecy in the Chinese Buddhist, Taoist and
      Confucianist traditions. In the 20th century, Qigong movement has
      incorporated and popularized Daoist meditation, and “mainly employs
      concentrative exercises but also favors the circulation of energy in an
      inner-alchemical mode”

    <h3>How to do it?</h3>
    <p>
      There are thousands of different Qigong exercises cataloged, involving
      over 80 different types of breathing. Some are specific to martial arts
      (to energize and strengthen the body); others are for health (to nourish
      body functions or cure diseases); and others for meditation and spiritual
      cultivation. Qigong can be practiced in a static position (seated or
      standing), or through a dynamic set of movements – which is what you
      typically see in YouTube videos and on DVDs. The exercises that are done
      as a meditation, however, are normally done sitting down, and without
      movement. To understand more about Qigong and learn how to do it, I’d
      recommend getting a book or DVD set from Dr. Yang Jwing Ming. <br /><br />

      <ul>
        <li>
          Sit in a comfortable position. Make sure your body is balanced and
          centered.
        </li>
        <li>Relax your whole body – muscles, nerves, and internal organs</li>

        <li>
          Place all your attention in the “lower dantien”, which is the center
          of gravity of the body, two inches below the navel. This will help
          accumulate and root the qi (vital energy). Where your mind and
          intention is, there will be your qi. So, by focusing on the dantien,
          you are gathering energy in this natural reservoir.
        </li>
        <li>Feel the qi circulating freely through your body.</li>
        <br /><br />
        <i><p>Other famous Qigong exercises are:</p></i>
        <li>Small Circulation (also called “microcosmic circulation”)</li>
        <li>Embryonic Breathing</li>
        <li>Eight Pieces of Brocade</li>
        <li>Muscle Tendon Changing(or “Yi Jin Jing”, taught by Bodhidharma)</li>
        <br /><br />
      </ul>
      <p>
        The first two are seated meditation, while the latter two are dynamic
        Qigong, integrating body stretches.

    <h3>Is it for me?</h3>
    <p>
      Qigong meditation may be more attractive to people that like to integrate
      a more active body and energy work into the practice. If seated meditation
      is unbearable for you, and you prefer something a bit more active, try
      some of the more dynamic forms of Qigong. Again, there are several styles
      of Qigong out there, and you may need to try with different teachers or
      DVDs to find the one that suits you. Some people have a taste of dynamic
      Qigong through the practice of Tai Chi.
