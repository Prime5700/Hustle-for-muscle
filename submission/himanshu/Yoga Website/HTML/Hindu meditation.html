    <h2>Hindu Meditation</h2>
    <p>
      Hinduism is a religion, or a way of life, found most notably in India and
      Nepal. With approximately one billion followers, Hinduism is the world’s
      third largest religion by population, and the majority religion in India,
      Nepal and Bali (Indonesia). Hinduism has been called the “oldest religion”
      in the world, and some practitioners and scholars refer to it as Sanātana
      Dharma, “the eternal law” or the “eternal way” beyond human origins.
      <br /><br />
      Most notably yoga and meditation have emerged as popular spiritual
      practices in modern times that stem from the Hinduism.

      <li><h3>Mantra Meditation (OM Meditation)</h3></li>
      <h4>Origin & Meaning</h4>
      <p>
        A mantra is a syllable or word, usually without any particular meaning,
        that is repeated for the purpose of focusing your mind. It is not an
        affirmation used to convince yourself of something. Some meditation
        teachers insist that both the choice of word, and its correct
        pronunciation, is very important, due to the “vibration” associated to
        the sound and meaning, and that for this reason an initiation into it is
        essential. Others say that the mantra itself is only a tool to focus the
        mind, and the chosen word is completely irrelevant. Mantras are used in
        Hindu traditions, Buddhist traditions (especially Tibetan and “Pure
        Land” Buddhism), as well as in Jainism, Sikhism and Daoism (Taoism).
        Some people call mantra meditation “om meditation”, but that is just one
        of the mantras that can be used. A more devotion oriented practice of
        mantras is called japa, and consists of repeating sacred sounds (name of
        God) with love.

      <h4>How to do it</h4>
      <p>
        As most type of meditations, it is usually practiced sitting with spine
        erect, and eyes closed. The practitioner then repeats the mantra in his
        mind, silently, over and over again during the whole session.
        <br /><br />
        Sometimes this practice is coupled with being aware of the breathing or
        coordinating with it. In other exercises, the mantra is actually
        whispered very lightly and softly, as an aid to concentration.
      </p>
      <i
        ><p>
          As you repeat the mantra, it creates a mental vibration that allows
          the mind to experience deeper levels of awareness. As you meditate,
          the mantra becomes increasingly abstract and indistinct, until you’re
          finally led into the field of pure consciousness from which the
          vibration arose. <br /><br />
          Repetition of the mantra helps you disconnect from the thoughts
          filling your mind so that perhaps you may slip into the gap between
          thoughts. The mantra is a tool to support your meditation practice.
          Mantras can be viewed as ancient power words with subtle intentions
          that help us connect to spirit, the source of everything in the
          universe.

        <h4>
          Here are some of the most well-known mantras from the Hindu tradition:
        </h4>
        <li>om</li>
        <li>so-ham</li>
        <li>om namah shivaay</li>
        <li>om mani padme hum</li>
        <li>rama</li>
        <li>yama</li>
        <li>ham</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You may practice for a certain period of time, or for a set number of
        “repetitions” – traditionally 108 or 1008. In the latter case, beads are
        typically used for keeping count. <br /><br />
        As the practice deepens, you may find that the mantra continues “by
        itself” like the humming of the mind. Or the mantra may even disappear,
        and you are left in a state of deep inner peace.
      </p>
      <h4>Is it for me?</h4>
      <p>
        People usually find that it is easier to focus with a mantra than with
        the breathing. Because a mantra is a word, and thoughts are usually
        perceived as words, it can be easier to keep the focus on a mantra
        rather than on the breathing. It is useful especially when the mind is
        racing with many thoughts, since it mantra meditation demands constant
        attention. <br /><br />
        Meditating with a mantra can also make it simpler to integrate your
        meditative state into your daily life. In whatever activity you find
        yourself into, it can be as simple as repeating the mantra in your mind.

      <li><h3>Transcendental Meditation (TM)</h3></li>
      <h4>Origin & Meaning</h4>
      <p>
        Transcendental Meditation is a specific form of Mantra Meditation
        introduced by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi in 1955 in India and the West. In
        the late 1960s and early 1970s, the Maharishi achieved fame as the guru
        to the Beatles, The Beach Boys and other celebrities.
        <br /><br />
        It is a widely practiced form of meditation, with over 5 million
        practitioners worldwide, and there is a lot of scientific research,
        sponsored by the organization, demonstrating the benefits of the
        practice. However, there are also critics of the Maharishi and his
        organization.
      </p>
      <h4>How to do it?</h4>
      <p>
        Transcendental meditation is not taught freely. The only way of learning
        it is to pay to learn from one of their licensed instructors. The
        support given seems to be good, though. <br /><br />
        In general, however, it is known that TM involves the use of a mantra
        and is practiced for 15–20 minutes twice per day while sitting with
        one’s eyes closed. The mantra is not unique, and is given to the
        practitioner based on his gender and age. They are also not “meaningless
        sounds” – rather, they are Tantric names of Hindu deities.
      </p>
      <h4>Is it for me?</h4>
      <p>
        Personally I don’t feel comfortable advising anyone to try
        Transcendental Meditation anymore. My recent research has shown a lot of
        doubtful practices of “scientific research” and concealment of the
        religious nature of the movement. Email me if you want to know more.
        <br /><br />
        If you wish to try something similar, have a look at NSR (above), or
        Mantra Meditation.

      <li><h3>Yoga Meditation</h3></li>
      <p>
        There is not one type of meditation which is “Yogic Meditation”, so here
        it is meant the several meditation types taught in the yoga tradition.
        Yoga means “union”. Tradition goes as far as 1700 B.C, and has as its
        highest goal spiritual purification and Self-Knowledge. Classical Yoga
        divides the practice into rules of conduct ( yamas and niyamas ),
        physical postures ( asanas ), breathing exercises ( pranayama ), and
        contemplative practices of meditation ( pratyahara , dharana , dhyana ,
        samadhi ).

      <h4>Is it for me?</h4>
      <p>
        With all these types of Hindu meditation, you are likely to find one
        that you like. If you are a musician, perhaps nada yoga is something
        that will attract you. If you are a devotional person, kriya yoga is a
        good option. Kundalini and Chakra meditation should only be attempted
        with a teacher. <br /><br />
        Probably the simplest one to try is the “third eye meditation”, which is
        simple and yields results fairly quickly. For the other types you would
        probably need more instruction, either of a teacher or a good book (see
        references above). Besides, Pranayama is definitely something anyone can
        benefit from.

      <li><h3>Self-Enquiry and “I Am” Meditation</h3></li>
      <h4>Origin & Meaning</h4>
      <p>
        Self-Enquiry is the English translation for the Sanskrit term atma
        vichara. It means to “investigate” our true nature, to find the answer
        to the “Who am I?” question, which culminates with the intimate
        knowledge of our true Self, our true being. We see references to this
        meditation in very old Indian texts; however, it was greatly popularized
        and expanded upon by the 20th-century Indian sage Ramana Maharshi
        (1879~1950). <br /><br />
        The modern non-duality movement (or neo-advaita ), which is greatly
        inspired in his teachings – as well as those of Nisargadatta Maharaj
        (1897~1981) and Papaji – strongly uses this technique and variations.
        Many contemporary teachers to employ this technique, the most famous
        ones being Mooji (whom I’ve personally been with and recommend),
        Adyashanti , and Eckhart Tolle.
      </p>
      <h4>How to do it?</h4>
      <p>
        This practice is very simple, but also very subtle. When explaining it,
        however, it may sound very abstract. <br /><br />
        Your sense of “I” (or “ego”) is the center of your universe. It is
        there, in some form or another, behind all your thoughts, emotions,
        memories, and perceptions. Yet we are not clear about what this “I” is –
        about who we truly are, in essence – and confuse it with our body, our
        mind, our roles, our labels. It’s the biggest mystery in our lives.
        <br /><br />
        With Self-Enquiry, the question “Who I am?” is asked within yourself.
        You must reject any verbal answers that may come, and use this question
        simply as a tool to fix your attention in the subjective feeling of “I”
        or “I am”. Become one with it, go deep into it. This will then reveal
        your true “I”, your real self as pure consciousness, beyond all
        limitation. It is not an intellectual pursuit, but a question to bring
        the attention to the core element of your perception and experience: the
        “I”. This is not your personality, but a pure, subjective, feeling of
        existing – without any images or concepts attached to it.
        <br />
        Whenever thoughts/feelings arise, you ask yourself, “To whom does this
        arise?” or “Who is aware of _____ (anger, fear, pain, or whatever)?” The
        answer will be “It’s me!”. From then you ask “Who am I?”, to bring the
        attention back to the subjective feeling of self, of presence. It is
        pure existence, objectless and choice-less awareness.
        <br /><br />
        Another way of explaining this practice is to just focus the mind on
        your feeling of being, the non-verbal “I am” that shines inside of you.
        Keep it pure, without association with anything you perceive.
        <br /><br />
        On all other types of meditation, the “I” (yourself) is focusing on some
        object, internal or external, physical or mental. In self-enquiry, the
        “I” is focusing on itself, the subject. It is the attention turned
        towards its source. There is no special position to practice, although
        the general suggestions about posture and environment are helpful for
        beginners.
      </p>
      <h4>Is it for me?</h4>
      <p>
        This meditation is very powerful in bringing inner freedom and peace; so
        you should give it a try.
        <br />
        Yet, if you don’t have previous experience with meditation, you should
        take some guidance from someone experienced in meditation
