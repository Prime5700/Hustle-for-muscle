    <h2>Buddhist Meditation Techniques & Practices</h2>
    <p>
      You probably know that the increasingly popular practices of mindfulness
      and meditation share Buddhist roots. But did you know that there are many
      different schools of Buddhism, each with its own meditation techniques and
      methods? This is because after the time of the historic Buddha, Siddhartha
      Gautama, in the 6th century BCE, Buddhism spread far and wide.
      <br />
      As it spread, it adopted some of the characteristics and spiritual
      strengths of the lands where it became implanted. All forms of Buddhism –
      and, by extension Buddhist meditation techniques – have arisen from the
      Buddha’s insights about the nature of existence, the causes of suffering,
      the causes of happiness, and guidelines for living a wholesome and
      constructive life. Buddhist meditation practices have now spread beyond
      the borders of the countries where they developed organically and are more
      widely available than ever before.

    <h2>How do Buddhists Meditate?</h2>
    <p>
      Tibetan visualization practices, Zen, vipassana, Pure Land, Nichiren and a
      number of other Buddhist forms of meditation are now taught and practiced
      all over the western world. Below we present 3 inspiring methods; if you
      explore a bit, you’ll surely find many more!

      <li><h3>Shamatha</h3></li>
      <p>
        Shamatha (mindfulness) is a well-known Buddhist practice that focuses on
        developing calmness, clarity and equanimity. With the proper guidance
        and commitment, the cultivation of these qualities can ultimately lead
        to deep inner peace. When combined with vipassana (awareness) practices,
        it can lead to profound insights and spiritual awakening. The initial
        stages of mindfulness meditation are essentially non-denominational and
        can be practiced by anyone, regardless of their faith tradition.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>
          The basis of shamatha, or mindfulness meditation, is as
          follows:</strong
        >
      </p>
      <div class="ul">
        <ul>
          <li>
            Sit in a comfortable meditation posture: find a pose that doesn’t
            hurt your back or knees. Watch our Take Your Seat video on the
            Mindworks App or see our post to learn about the best Buddhist
            meditation postures. Keep your back straight and try to find a happy
            medium between too rigid and too relaxed.
          </li>
          <li>
            Observe your breath: You don’t have to manipulate your breath, use
            abdominal breathing or have long, deep in-breaths and out-breaths.
            Just breathe normally and pay attention to your breathing process,
            one breath at a time. Keep your awareness focused but be gentle; you
            should have an attitude of discovering and making friends with
            yourself.
          </li>
          <li>
            Acknowledge the thoughts that pop into your mind without engaging
            them. Simply observe them and let go. Come back to the breath. We
            call this “touch and go.” Let the thought arise, touch on it gently,
            and then let it go.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
      </div>
      <li>
        <div class="ol">

            alt="Metta Loving-Kindness meditation image"
            width="28%"
          />
        </div>
        <div class="ol">
          <img

            width="28%"
          />
        </div>
        <h3>Metta or lovingkindness</h3>
      </li>
      <p>
        Another popular method for how to practice Buddhist meditation is Metta,
        or lovingkindness, meditation. There are many different forms of this
        meditation as well. They begin with a period of śamatha to get the mind
        settled and receptive.
        <br />
        <br />
        In one technique, we begin by directing wishes for well-being and
        lovingkindness toward ourselves. Then we open it out and direct
        lovingkindness towards a person or pet that we love. Then someone we
        feel neutral about, followed by somebody we have problems with or even
        an enemy. Ultimately our love flows equally towards all beings
        everywhere, regardless of how we feel about them. This form of
        meditation is about feeling the love and radiating out until the
        distinct edges that usually categorize us as “me, friend, enemy, etc.”
        fade away and what is left is benevolence, pure and simple.
        <br />
        <br />
        We might repeat slogans or mantras that inspire our practice, such as
        “May my love for myself and others flow freely.” Or “May I and all
        living beings be safe, happy and peaceful.” A traditional Buddhist
        invocation is “May all beings find happiness and the cause of happiness.
        May they be free from suffering and the cause of suffering.” After a
        period of active metta practice, we sit in quiet awareness for a time.

        <img
          class="img"
          src="../Images/contemplative2.jpg"

          width="50%"
        />
      </div>
      <li><h3>Contemplative meditation</h3></li>
      <p>
        The Buddhist teachings share some fundamental beliefs. Practitioners are
        encouraged to reflect on them in a focused, contemplative manner. This
        contemplation may be integrated into a practice session. One of the
        best-known contemplations is called “The Four Thoughts that Transform
        the Mind.” Their purpose is to give us a good reason to sit down and
        practice rather than, for example, spend the next two hours on social
        media or in a shopping mall.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>These four thoughts, in brief, are:</strong>
      </p>
      <div class="ul">
        <ul>
          <li>
            I can choose to devote my energy to developing wisdom, compassion
            and the power to benefit others. Many people in other situations, as
            well as other forms of life such as animals, don’t have this
            possibility. I recognize the preciousness of this opportunity and
            vow not to waste it.
          </li>
          <li>
            But who knows how long this precious life will last? Everything
            changes. My entire existence depends on an out-breath being followed
            by an in-breath. No time to waste!
          </li>
          <li>
            Everything that exists has a cause, and every action has
            consequences. This speaks to the truth of interdependence – and
            means that our actions have more of an impact than we might imagine.
          </li>
          <li>
            At one point or another, we will be separated from all of the
            material things we’re attached to. So much effort, so little lasting
            gain! Doesn’t it make more sense to focus our energy on being of
            benefit by developing the precious qualities of wisdom, compassion,
            and spiritual skills? May my meditation practice help me reach this
            goal!
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </ol>
    <h2>Guided Buddhist Meditation</h2>
    <p>
      If you’re just starting your Buddhist meditation practice but aren’t quite
      sure how to go about it, try following a guided meditation. The Mindworks:
      Guided Meditation App, for instance, offers a variety of guided
      meditations for meditators of all levels. The App also contains lots of
      other content, such as helpful Mind Talks from reliable, expert meditation
      guides.
      <br />
      <br />
      For instance, in one of these inspiring Mind Talks the world-renowned
      Buddhist master Trungram Gyalwa talks about the immense benefits of
      meditation. Also check out our companion article What is Buddhist
      Meditation? You might also join a local meditation class. It’s a great way
