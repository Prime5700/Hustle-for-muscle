  <h3>Benefits</h3>
  <p><strong>►Isotonic Benefits</strong> </p>
  <p> Replenishing your energy sources is a must, especially when you are in the middle of intense training. This prevents you from stopping before you reach your optimal potential, owing to a lack of energy. </p>
  <p>MuscleBlaze Isotonic 2.2 lb Orange hydrates and energizes sportspersons, fitness enthusiasts, and athletes. Heavy duty workouts and sports result in the loss of fluids and electrolytes, via sweat resulting in fatigue, reduced energy and less than optimum performance. The unique formulation of Isotonic Instant Energy Formula from MuscleBlaze is an instant energy formula that helps restore lost electrolytes and aids in speeding up recovery in athletes, sportspersons, and gym goers. </p>
  <p><strong>►Keeps you Hydrated</strong></p>
  <p> When you are indulging in an intense physical activity, it is natural for you to sweat.  This leads to a lot of fluid loss and can eventually cause dehydration. With each serving of muscleBlaze isotonic instant energy formula, you get 754 mg of electrolytes that keep you hydrated and prevent any chances of cramping or dehydration.  </p>
  <p><strong>►Replenishing Energy</strong></p>
  <p>  Glucose gives you the energy that you need to carry out the most intense training sessions. With one serving of muscleBlaze isotonic drink, you get 15 grams of dextrose which is easy to absorb form of glucose. As a result, your fatigue threshold is increased and you also have enough energy to pull through rigorous training. </p>
  <p><strong>►Taste</strong> </p>
  <p>This isotonic drink is available in refreshing flavors like orange, pineapple, and watermelon. </p>
