        <h1 class="yoga">What is Meditation?</h1>
        <p>Meditation is a practice where an individual uses a technique – such as mindfulness, or focusing the mind on a
        particular object, thought or activity – to train attention and awareness, and achieve a mentally clear and emotionally
        calm and stable state. Scholars have found meditation difficult to define, as
        practices vary both between traditions and within them.
        
        Meditation has been practiced since antiquity in numerous religious traditions, often as part of the path towards
        enlightenment and self realization. Some of the earliest written records of meditation (Dhyana), come from the Hindu
        traditions of Vedantism. Since the 19th century, Asian meditative techniques have spread to other cultures where they
        have also found application in non-spiritual contexts, such as business and health.
        
        Meditation may be used with the aim of reducing stress, anxiety, depression, and pain, and increasing peace,
        perception, self-concept, and well-being. Meditation is under research to define its possible health
        (psychological, neurological, and cardiovascular) and other effects.
            Meditation or “dhyana” is an extreme form of concentration. It allows your mind to focus on one thing and detaches you
        from all worldly things. Meditation is one of The 8 Limbs of Yoga. It is believed that all divine powers live in the
        heart and meditation is the only route to dive deep into your heart. Though meditation is not an answer to all your
        problems, but it sure results in a harmony between body and soul. To reap the full benefits of meditation, regular
        practice is required.</p>
        <br>
        <h1 class="yoga">How to Meditate</h1>
        <p>To mediate you must sit comfortably and start focusing on one thought, object or even your breathing. Initially your
        mind will wander. Do not try to stop it. Let it go. Do not suppress any feelings or thought, but let these pass. Once
        done your mind will automatically return to your object of focus. Now your mind will be at peace.
        
        With time your mind will wander less and within no time you will enter into a phase of deep concentration. Mediation
        will bring you to the present.</p>
        <br>
        <h1 class="yoga">Importance Of Meditation</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>By daily practicing meditation you will become a calmer person. There will be a mental serenity in every task you
            perform. Each day you will have a different experience so never think about the day gone by, but on the present.</li>
            <li>Today’s life is full of stress, which further influences our day to day activities. Meditation helps in reducing stress
            by affecting your nervous system. Meditation reduces the production of stress related hormones like cortisol and
            increases the production of good chemicals like serotonin.</li>
            <li>Sound sleep is very important for the proper functioning of the body. When your mind works faster than required, you do
            not get proper sleep. Regular meditation helps in relieving stress and thus improves the quality of sleep.</li>
            <li>Less stress means more happiness. You will live a happier and healthier life with meditation.</li>
            <li>People suffering from anxiety and depression must mediate daily for 15-20 mins. Mediation also helps in controlling
            anger.</li>
            <li>Meditation enhances energy gain from inner sources.</li>
            <li>You live a disciplined life and cultivate good habits.</li>
            <li>Improved concentration is the result of meditation.</li>
            <li>It is believed that meditation improves the immune system and thereby helps in controlling blood pressure and lowering
            blood cholesterol.</li>
            <li>Meditation slows down aging.</li>
            <li>Meditation provides emotional stability.</li>
            <li>By making meditation a routine, a consciousness develops and gradually you will reach a point of highest consciousness.</li>
            <li>It will help you learn about yourself as well as the mysteries of life. It will give meaning to your life.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <h2>Clinical Applications of Medetation:</h2>
            <p>The US National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health states that "Meditation is a mind and body practice that
            has a long history of use for increasing calmness and physical relaxation, improving psychological balance, coping with
            illness, and enhancing overall health and well-being." A 2014 review found that practice of mindfulness
            meditation for two to six months by people undergoing long-term psychiatric or medical therapy could produce small
            improvements in anxiety, pain, or depression. In 2017, the American Heart Association issued a scientific statement
            that meditation may be a reasonable adjunct practice to help reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases, with the
            qualification that meditation needs to be better defined in higher-quality clinical research of these disorders.
            
            Low-quality evidence indicates that meditation may help with irritable bowel syndrome, insomnia, cognitive
            decline in the elderly, and post-traumatic stress disorder.</p>

               Did you know that there are as many meditation techniques as there are sports? And the only way to find out the best
            types of meditation for you is to try them.
            <br>
            As you may know, meditation has dozens of     benefits, and everybody is doing it. You look for information online or on a
            bookstore, and see that there are a LOT of     different styles of meditation. You wonder which way is best for you.
    <br>
            This is a very important question. Different     types of meditation have different benefits. Some of them will work better
            for you than others—just like different sports or diets             work better for some people than for others.

            There are literally hundreds—if not thousands—of types of             meditation, so here I will explore only the most popular             ones.
            The purpose of this article is to help you experiment             different meditation techniques, and find the ones that             works best
            for you.

            Finding the right style for you, and practicing it with             the right approach, is one of the three essential Pillars             of
            Meditation.

            There is no cookie-cutter approach to meditation. You             need to experiment many, and find the one that works best             for your
            unique needs and personality. The type of meditation that             is most helpful against anxiety, for instance, is not
            necessarily the best one against depression or for             spiritual awakening.</p>
