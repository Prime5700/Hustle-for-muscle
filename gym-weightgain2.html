  <h2 style="font-size: 40px; color: orangered;" id="abc">Science Of Weight Gain</h2>
  <p>The best way to build muscle is with resistance training and progressive overload. Different programs target different goals for hypertrophy (mass) versus strength. People new to resistance training should focus on building a decent base level of strength and muscle definition, as well as practicing good form, before trying to add specificity to their program.</p>
  <p>Muscle is made when you eat and sleep: Nutrition and recovery are extremely important for people who lift weights.</p>
  <p>Human muscles are combination of large and small fibres of muscles,when we target specific muscle through weight resistance training than the fibers of that specific muscle is torn apart and needs recovery witin 72 hours thus to fullfill such need you are advised to eat a perfect balanced diet with increased quantity of proteins.</p>
  <h3 style="font-size: 40px; color: orangered;" id="def">How To Do</h3>
  <p>In order to gain weight </p>
  <ul>
      <li>Warm up your body with push-ups,pull-ups,sit-ups and stretching</li>
      <li>Train only single part of body in a day if you are beginner</li>
      <li>You may train two parts in a day as you become intermediate</li>
      <li>Perform 6 to 7 Exercises of large muscles [Chest,Back and Legs]</li>
      <li>Perform 4 to 5 Exercises of small muscles [Biceps,Triceps and Shoulders]</li>
      <li>There are 3 sets to perform a exercise</li>
      <li>The weight should be minimum in first set</li>
      <li>The weight should be maximum in Last set</li>
  </ul>
  <h4 style="font-size: 40px; color: orangered;" id="ghi">Dietary Plan</h4>
  <p>An average person needs approximately 3000 calories to gain one kilograms of weight in a week</p>
  <ul>
        <li>Start your day by drinking 2 medium size glass of luke warm water mix with honey</li>
        <li>Try to eat every 3 hours</li>
        <li>Eat potatoes,curd,eggs,supplements or wheat breads in breakfast</li>
        <li>Prefer rice,salads,vegetables,wheat breads and any other high calorie food in your lunch</li>
        <li>You may switch to a premium quality protein and Gainers as a supplement</li>
        <li>Eat butter stuffed sandwich in your post lunch</li>
        <li>Eat high quality and quantity of carbs before 1.5 hour going to gym</li>
        <li>Eat only high protein quantity stuffs just after gym</li>
        <li>Eat low carbs and high protein dinner [avoid rice and breads]</li>
        <li>Eat anything of your likes and dislikes but stick to load 3000 calories a day [ carbs and protein contain 4 calories whereas fat contain 9 calories in a gram]</li>
        <li>Therefore if you eat 10 grams of crabs and 10 grams of protein and 10 grams of fat than it will provide you with 170 calories</li>
  </ul>
