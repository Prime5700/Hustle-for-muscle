    <p id="mid">The purpose of rehabilitation is to restore some or all of the patient's physical, sensory, and mental capabilities that were lost due to injury, illness, or disease. Rehabilitation includes assisting the patient to compensate for deficits that cannot be reversed medically. It is prescribed after many types of injury, illness, or disease, including amputations, arthritis, cancer, cardiac disease, neurological problems, orthopedic injuries, spinal cord injuries, stroke, and traumatic brain injuries. The Institute of Medicine has estimated that as many as 14% of all Americans may be disabled at any given time.</p>

    <p id="mid">A proper and adequate rehabilitation program can reverse many disabling conditions or can help patients cope with deficits that cannot be reversed by medical care. Rehabilitation addresses the patient's physical, psychological, and environmental needs. It is achieved by restoring the patient's physical functions and/or modifying the patient's physical and social environment. The main types of rehabilitation are physical, occupational, and speech therapy.
        <br>   
        Each rehabilitation program is tailored to the individual patient's needs and can include one or more types of therapy. The patient's physician usually coordinates the efforts of the rehabilitation team, which can include physical, occupational, speech, or other therapists; nurses; engineers; physiatrists (physical medicine); psychologists; orthotists (makes devices such as braces to straighten out curved or poorly shaped bones); prosthetists (a therapist who makes artificial limbs or protheses); and vocational counselors. Family members are often actively involved in the patient's rehabilitation program.</p>

        <p id="mid">Physical therapy helps the patient restore the use of muscles, bones, and the nervous system through the use of heat, cold, massage, whirlpool baths, ultrasound, exercise, and other techniques. It seeks to relieve pain, improve strength and mobility, and train the patient to perform important everyday tasks. Physical therapy may be prescribed to rehabilitate a patient after amputations, arthritis, burns, cancer, cardiac disease, cervical and lumbar dysfunction, neurological problems, orthopedic injuries, pulmonary disease, spinal cord injuries, stroke, traumatic brain injuries, and other injuries/illnesses. The duration of the physical therapy program varies depending on the injury/illness being treated and the patient's response to therapy.</p>

            <li>Acute or Physician Care: To Stabilize Your Condition - For serious injuries and medical conditions like stroke, brain injury or multiple traumas, inpatient rehabilitation care follows an acute-care hospital stay. For injuries like sprains, strains and fractures, a visit to a physician will be the first line of care.</li>
            <li>Inpatient Rehabilitation: To Regain Function and Independence - Patients typically receive at least three hours of physical, occupational, speech or recreational therapy each day at a rehabilitation facility such as Good Shepherd Rehabilitation Hospital-Allentown. A multidisciplinary team of physicians, therapists and nurses develop and oversee a treatment plan to meet individual goals. Why choose Good Shepherd for your inpatient rehabilitation?</li>
            <li>Outpatient Rehab: To Maintain and Improve Function - Patients who are discharged from inpatient rehabilitation will continue therapy in an outpatient facility, such as Good Shepherd Physical Therapy. Patients with less serious conditions may be referred right to an outpatient facility for treatment. Maintaining function on an ongoing basis may include joining a medical-model fitness center, fitness class or support group.</li>
