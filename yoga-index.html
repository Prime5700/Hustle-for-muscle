    <h1 class="yoga">Importance of Yoga</h1>
    <p>
      Yoga is not a religion, it is a way of living that aims towards a healthy
      mind in a healthy body. Man is a physical, mental and spiritual being;
      yoga helps promote a balanced development of all the three. Other forms of
      physical exercises, like aerobics, assure only physical well-being. They
      have little to do with the development of the spiritual or astral body.
    </p>
    <h5>
      Yogic exercises recharge the body with cosmic energy and facilitates:
    </h5>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Attainment of perfect equilibrium and harmony Promotes self- healing.
      </li>
      <li>negative blocks from the mind and toxins from the body</li>
      <li>Enhances personal power</li>
      <li>Yoga to live with greater awareness</li>
      <li>
        Helps in attention, focus and concentration, especially important for
        children
      </li>
      <li>
        stress and tension in the physical body by activating the
        parasympathetic nervous system
      </li>
      <li>Yoga for better relationships</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Benefits of Yoga</h5>
    <p>
      The art of practicing yoga helps in controlling an individual’s mind, body
      and soul. It brings together physical and mental disciplines to achieve a
      peaceful body and mind; it helps manage stress and anxiety and keeps you
      relaxing. It also helps in increasing flexibility, muscle strength and
      body tone. It improves respiration, energy and vitality. Practicing yoga
      might seem like just stretching, but it can do much more for your body
      from the way you feel, look and move. Yoga asanas build strength,
      flexibility and confidence. Regular practice of yoga can help lose weight,
      relieve stress, improve immunity and maintain a healthier lifestyle.
    </p>
    <h5>Goals</h5>
    <p>
      The ultimate goal of Yoga is moksha (liberation), although the exact form
      this takes depends on the philosophical or theological system with which
      it is conjugated.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <h6>
        According to Jacobsen, Yoga has five principal traditional meanings:
      </h6>
      <li>a disciplined method for attaining a goal;</li>
      <li>techniques of controlling the body and the mind;</li>
      <li>a name of a school or system of philosophy (darśana);</li>
      <li>
        with prefixes such as "hatha-, mantra-, and laya-, traditions
        specialising in particular techniques of yoga;
      </li>
      <li>the goal of Yoga practice.</li>
    </ol>
    <h5>Yoga as an Exercise</h5>
    <p>
      Yoga as exercise is a physical activity consisting largely of asanas,
      often connected by flowing sequences called vinyasas, sometimes
      accompanied by the breathing exercises of pranayama, and usually ending
      with a period of relaxation or meditation. It is often known simply as
      yoga, despite the existence of multiple older traditions of yoga within
      Hinduism where asanas played little or no part, some dating back to the
      Yoga Sutras, and despite the fact that in no tradition was the practice of
      asanas central.

    <h3>Types Of Yoga</h3>
    <ol>
      <div class="img"><a href="#">

      </a></div>
      <li id="Vinyasa"><a href="#">Vinyasa Yoga</a></li>
      <p>
        Vinyasa yoga is popular and is taught at most studios and gyms.
        “Vinyasa” means linking breath with movement. The postures are usually
        done in a flowing sequence, or "vinyasa flow." The fluid movements can
        be memorized and done as a moving meditation, almost like a dance. The
        popularity of this style of yoga comes from the sensual movements,
        pleasant music, usually (but not always) practiced in a dark room, or
        sometimes by candlelight and with the eyes closed.
      </p>

      </a></div>
      <li id="Ashtanga"><a href="#">Ashtanga Yoga</a></li>
      <p>
        Ashtanga means “eight limbs” and encompasses a yogic lifestyle. Most
        people identify Ashtanga as traditional Indian yoga. Like Vinyasa yoga,
        the Ashtanga yoga asanas (postures) synchronize breath with movement as
        you move through a series of postures. It was brought to the United
        States by Sri K. Pattabhi Jois in the early 20th century. The series of
        postures are practiced the same way every time and consist of Sun
        Salutation A, Sun Salutation B, a standing sequence, and a closing
        sequence. The practice is usually performed without music, and sometimes
        without verbal instruction (in silence).

    <li id="Iyenger"><a href="#">Iyenger Yoga</a></li>
    <p>Also based on the Eight Limbs of Yoga, Iyengar yoga is named after B.K.S. Iyengar, a famous yogi from India. It was
    popularized in the West about the same time as Ashtanga yoga.
    
    The emphasis on this practice is alignment in the asanas using breath control through pranayama and the use of props
    (bolsters, blankets, blocks and straps.) This style of yoga is usually taught without music and at a slower pace
    designed to assist students to get deeper into the postures.</p>

    <li id="Bikram"><a href="#">Bikram Yoga</a></li>
    <p>Bikram yoga was designed by Bikram Choudhury in the 1970s, who brought the practice to California from India.
    
    Class consists of the same twenty-six yoga postures and two breathing exercises. It is ninety minutes long and done in a
    room that is 105 degrees Fahrenheit with 40% humidity. The room is bright and the students face mirrors to check proper
    posture and alignment. There is no music during class.</p>

    <li id="Jivamukti"><a href="#">Jivamukti Yoga</a></li>
    <p>Jivamukti was created in 1984 by Sharon Gannon and David Life in New York City. ivamukti translates to “liberated
    being.”
    
    Class incorporates Sanskrit chanting, Pranayama, and movement (Asanas), with a theme or lesson for each class. This is a
    good blend of spiritual and physical exercise.</p>
    <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

    <div class="img"><a href="#"><img src="./img/Power.jpg" width="400" height="250" alt="Power Yoga"></a></div>
    <li id="Power"><a href="#">Power Yoga</a></li>
    <p>Power yoga is a more active approach to the traditional Hatha yoga poses. The Ashtanga yoga poses are performed more
    quickly and with added core exercises and upper body work.
    
    The sequences are not the same every time, and there is often upbeat music. Vinyasa yoga can also be Power yoga,
    depending on the gym or studio that is hosting the class.</p>

    <div class="img"><a href="#"><img src="./img/Sivananda.jpg" width="400" height="250" alt=""></a></div>
    <li id="Sivananda"><a href="#">Sivananda Yoga</a></li>
    <p>Sivananda Yoga is a classical yoga system founded by Swami Vishnudevananda. He named this spiritual yoga system, as well
    as the international Sivananda Yoga Vedanta Centre organization responsible for propagating its teachings, after his
    beloved guru, Swami Sivananda with the mission 'to spread the teachings of yoga and the message of world peace
    which has since been refined to 'practice and teach the ancient yogic knowledge for health, peace, unity in diversity
    and Self-realization.</p>
    <br><br><br><br><br>
    <div class="img"><a href="#"><img src="./img/Yin.jpg" height="300" alt="Yin Yoga"></a></div>
    <li id="Yin"><a href="#">Yin Yoga</a></li>
    <p>Yin yoga is a meditative practice that allows your body to become comfortable in a pose without doing any work
    (strength). It is also called Taoist yoga, and focuses on lengthening the connective tissues within the body. It is
    meant to compliment Yang yoga, or muscle-forming yoga practices.
    
    If Yang is active, then Yin is passive, meaning the muscles are allowed to relax with gravity and rest. This is usually
    performed with the assistance of props, and there is little or no music in class.
    
    There are many more types and styles of yoga practices, and each one is unique. When you find a practice or a studio
    that works for you, stick with it. Make your practice part of your life, and you will begin to harvest the benefits of
    your dedication and consistency.
    
    If you are starting something new, come to class with an open mind. And let go of any expectations; you might surprise
    yourself and find joy in something that you thought was not going to work for you. Remember to be comfortable with
    change — although a teacher of a certain style of yoga might discourage you from straying, sometimes it’s good to mix it
    up, depending on what your body and soul may need during different aspects of your life or schedule. Whatever your yoga
    practice, embrace it with love and grace.</p>
