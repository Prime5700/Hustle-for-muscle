    <h2 id="subheading"><u>THE INDIVIDUAL WITH AMPUTATION</u></h2>
    <p id="mid">The development of temporary prosthetic function has been one of the most significant advances in
        rehabilitation over the past two decades . Automated
        fabrication using computer-aided design/computeraided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) promises to provide inexpensive, functional early-fit prostheses, as
        well as improved definitive limbs, at an acceptable
        cost. These new prostheses are designed to be
        lightweight, energy-storing, and adjustable at the
        socket interface in order to maintain socket fit as the
        residual limb matures. Their early and routine use
        leading up to definitive prosthetic fit is becoming
        standard accepted practice.
        When the first temporary prosthesis is fitted,
        physical activities are gradually begun. A temporary
        prosthesis is usually started after the wound is
        healed and a degree of residual limb shrinkage has
        occurred. Timing is important. If a prosthesis is
        made before the major portion of the shrinkage
        occurs, a new limb will be required within a few
        weeks. During the first year after surgery, the
        temporary prosthesis will require regular adjustments and often several replacements as the size and
        shape of the residual limb become stable.
        Physical conditioning may begin without wearing the prosthesis. Stretching and flexibility exercises, NautilusTM or similar seated weight-training
        machines, and sports such as swimming, stationary
        bicycling or rowing, water aerobics, and crutch soccer
        may be performed without a prosthesis . As the residual limb stabilizes in size, more time can be spent in
        activities that require wearing the prosthesis.
        The prosthesis should be viewed as an assistive
        device. Prostheses permit better performance, fit
        more comfortably, are lighter in weight, and look
        more realistic than ever before, but they do not
        replace a real leg in function. They do not automatically adjust to changes in weight or other causes of
        increased interface pressure.
        Many people who are getting their first prosthesis tend to start doing too much too quickly . This
        can often lead to pain and irritation of the residual
        limb or other parts of the body that are compensating for the amputation . It can result in the temporary inability to wear the prosthesis. Such setbacks
        are discouraging. The entire body, as well as the
        residual limb, needs to adjust to the new stresses.
        Until the individual is fully adapted to walking
        comfortably with the prosthesis, movements that
        produce increased stress (such as running) should
        not be attempted.
        Most healthy people with a unilateral lower
        limb amputation will be able to run or jog as they
        wish, and some may become successful competitors
        in sports events that require endurance running . In
        more limited circumstances, these activities are
        possible for those with bilateral amputations . For
        individuals who are subject to residual limb softtissue breakdown as a result of scarring—or for
        other reasons—as well as those with high-level
        amputations, it may be better to choose activities
        that do not require the use of a prosthesis.
        Exercise is effective only if it is done on a regular basis; sporadic exercise is not much better than no exercise at all. Ideally, one should start with an activity participated in prior to the amputation. Most people will be able to get back into shape. Many individuals who were not physically active before losing a limb have improved their physical condition. They have understood that being fit provides them with the energy they need to overcome their disability.
      </p>
      <h2 id="subheading"><u>Considerations for Older People</u></h2>
      <p id="mid">
        Most amputations performed today result from peripheral vascular disease, diabetes, and related con
        ditions ; a majority involve the lower limb and are related to the general health of the individual . Many of the individuals who require amputation are 60 years of age or older. This population poses a new challenge for health care and rehabilitation professionals. Accidents and other trauma-related causes account for a modest percentage, as do tumors . A small segment of the amputee population results from congenital limb loss and congenital limb deficiencies, while war-related and natural disaster amputations remain a factor in many areas of the world. Physical fitness for the older adult is important. Muscles lose their elasticity with passing years. Changes in the arteries and the pumping action of the heart may cause a decrease in blood delivery to exercising muscles . Moderate physical activity can slow the aging process and provide the benefits of better health. In beginning an exercise program, each aspect of muscle conditioning must be gradual and carefully monitored because, for some older individuals, even a gentle exercise routine can involve risk. As strength is developed, walking and light jogging can become part of the routine. Consistency in performing the exercise program is especially important . The aging process is accompanied by diminishing muscle flexibility, strength, and endurance. A consistent physical fitness program has shown to slow these aging effects.

        <h2 id="subheading"><u>The Rehabilation Team</u></h2>
        <p id="mid">Rehabilitation of a person who has had an
                amputation requires a special care-giver team . No
                single health care discipline can provide all of the
                services needed . The patient is an active participant
                in each step of the recovery process . Along with the
                patient, the primary members of the rehabilitation
                team are the surgeon, physical therapist, nurse, and
                prosthetist.
                The initial purpose of this team is to monitor
                the healing process in preparation for fitting a
                prosthesis. Physical therapy begins in the hospital ; a
                program for physical conditioning is usually discussed later in the rehabilitation process.
                </p>
                <p id="mid"><u>Preoperative Considerations</u>
                  -When the amputation is elective, the physical part of the recovery process can actually begin prior to surgery. It consists of stretches to improve range of motion of joints and weight resistance exercises to increase strength and endurance . Rehabilitation goals may be discussed at that time to help the individual understand what he or she can expect in the way of return of function. A visit by one whose circumstances compare to those of the patient awaiting amputation is one of the best forms of preoperative counseling . An elderly person may view the upcoming amputation as the end of life: immobilized, confined to a wheelchair or bed, and totally dependent on others for care. A visit from an active person of the same age who has had an amputation can often overcome these fears. A young person is almost always responsive to a visit from a young amputee who has recently been snow skiing or bicycling or playing tennis. Apprehension about pain is a serious concern. The patient should know that pain will be properly controlled following surgery and that adequate medication can even allow for early movement and physical activity.

                  <h4 id="subheading"><u>Surgical Procedures</u></h4>
                  <p id="mid">
                    The surgeon who performs the amputation is responsible for selecting the level of limb removal and for reconstructing the residual soft tissues and bone . Technical details of amputation surgery (conservation of length, muscle stabilization, treatment of bone, nerves, blood vessels, and subcutaneous tissues) are critical to residual limb function. The muscles and remaining joints of the residual limb act to control the prosthesis. Muscle action through the tendon and aponeurosis attachments to bone also provide a sense of proprioception (position and movement) and are very important to prosthetic control. The degree and extent to which an individual with an amputation can engage in normal physical activities and sports will often be determined during surgery. Modern surgical techniques are described in medical textbooks, and new applications can be found in state-of-the-art monographs.
                    </p>
                    <h4 id="subheading"><u>Postoperative Rehabilitation</u></h4>
                    <p id="mid">
                      Emphasis upon immediate and progressive physical movement and prosthetic applications has accelerated the rehabilitation period for people of all ages . Two goals direct rehabilitation management. The first is to obtain uneventful wound healing . The second is to begin the rehabilitation process immediately. These objectives are best accomplished by rigid dressing management which provides support, protection and rest for the tissues, a clean woundhealing environment, and pain control. Because of these features, rigid dressings allow the patient to move about comfortably early in the postoperative
    period. The rigid dressing actually forms a receptacle which can serve as a socket for an immediate or early postoperative prosthesis . Limited weightbearing using crutches or a walker may begin as soon after surgery as the patient is able, with moderated increases in the amount of weight as wound healing progresses . Full weightbearing is not allowed until the use of a temporary socket can be tolerated. In other postoperative methods, elastic bandages (e.g., Ace® Brand'` Athletic Bandage) or an elastic stockinette are used to wrap the residual limb to prepare it for prosthetic fitting. The pylon and foot, which can be attached to a plaster cast, allow for early limited weightbearing . Soft dressings are easy to apply, but are not usually as effective as a rigid dressing. Progressive rehabilitation is the key to recovery. A carefully planned and well-timed recovery process that encourages optimum physical activity is basic to regaining a sense of "wholeness." The rehabilitation team will recommend community organizations that are involved in physical fitness and provide support services, such as National Handicapped Sports (NHS), which offers specialized instruction in adapting physical activities to individual disabilities .</p>
