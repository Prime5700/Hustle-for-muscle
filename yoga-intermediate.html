    <h2>
      Stepping It Up!! Moving from the Beginner to the Intermediate Practice?
    </h2>
    <p>
      What is the difference between a beginner and an intermediate
      practitioner? Say you’ve been at the practice for a number of months but
      don’t trust yourself to jump into a level two class yet. Or you’re a
      stay-at-home yogi and wondering what the next steps are in refining your
      practice. Perhaps you marvel at the strength and finesse of your teacher
      or fellow students and wonder how they’ve arrived at such grace. How do we
      take the practice to the intermediate level?
    </p>
    <br />
    <strong
      ><p>
        To move to the Intermediate Levelof Yoga, you need to develop the
        following traits:
      </p></strong
    >
    <!--start of unordered list-->
    <div class="ul">
      <ul>
        <li><h3>Commitment</h3></li>
        <p>
          The first step is showing up on your mat consistently. The beginner is
          sporadic—sometimes you feel full of vim and vigor and hit the mat 5
          times a week. One month later something shifts—the weather, stress
          levels at work, the phase of the moon—and suddenly you can’t drag
          yourself to class. The intermediate practitioner has a routine and she
          sticks to it no matter what. The trick is finding what works for
          you—an early bird class that you can get to before your day spins out
          of control, a home routine with an online platform that you can work
          into your evening...whatever it is that fits. And then learning to
          show up, even when you don’t really feel like it. Because meeting the
          mat when you don’t really feel like it is where most of the magic
          begins.
        </p>
        <li><h3>Curiosity</h3></li>
        <p>
          The beginner is satisfied with just enough information to get through
          the class. He needs to know where to put his right foot, what to do
          with his left hand. He needs to be reminded to pay attention to his
          breath. He might like to learn simple mantras or a few accessible arm
          balances. But too much information may overwhelm him, and might even
          discourage him from coming back to the practice. The intermediate
          practitioner is thirsty. He wants to know the deeper wisdom of the
          body: how muscles and bones and breath cooperate, how energy is guided
          and moved and efficiently used. He is hungry for philosophy and
          mysticism and storytelling, he begins to see that the practice extends
          far beyond the borders of his yoga mat.
        </p>
        <li><h3>Discernment</h3></li>
        <p>
          The beginner may not yet have the experience to know bullshit when she
          sees it. She may be inclined to believe everything she is fed in a
          yoga class. Or, on the other end of the spectrum, the beginner may be
          overly skeptical and suspicious. The intermediate practitioner finds
          the balance between open-mindedness and asking intelligent questions.
          She explores various perspectives—perhaps testing different styles of
          yoga, checking out a variety of studios or online options, or reading
          material from a wider range of credible authors. Or she delves in by
          participating in workshops, immersions or retreats. She knows too that
          each body is unique, and ultimately she is responsible for shaping the
          practice that will best suit her own needs.
        </p>
        <li><h3>Core</h3></li>
        <p>
          The most fundamental physiological difference between a beginner asana
          practice and an intermediate one is an ability to stabilize and move
          from the core. The intermediate practitioner understands a strong core
          not as a rock-hard lump at the center of the body, but rather as a
          sheath of various muscle layers which wrap around the abdominal
          cavity. She is able to feel the differences in core engagement which
          support the spine in it’s various positions. Her core stability allows
          her to safely perform movements such as Chaturanga, Handstands and
          deeper backbends. Core engagement keeps her asana practice light and
          efficient, so that she is able to do more with less effort.
        </p>
        <li><h3>Patience</h3></li>
        <p>
          The beginner believes either: the difficult poses will be immediately
          available and the practice will always be comfortable; or: the
          difficult poses will never be accessible to her body and she shouldn’t
          even bother trying. The intermediate practitioner knows that
          everything arrives in its own time. Difficult poses require a great
          deal of disciplined effort, and time. They rarely appear overnight.
          Extremely advanced postures may not be available to every body, but
          with effort and care most poses at the intermediate level can be
          achieved. In fact, often we’re surprised by how much we’re truly able
          to do with the right commitment and the ability to wait.
        </p>
        <li><h3>Breath</h3></li>
        <p>
          In the beginning, we’re just struggling to keep up with the motions,
          put our left foot in the right place, and not topple over. As we
          refine the practice, we learn that the breath is central to everything
          that we do—that attention to breath helps us to move through the
          practice without getting winded, that the breath helps us to place the
          left foot exactly, that the breath helps us to maintain balance and
          concentration. The intermediate practitioner works with breathing
          techniques such as ujjayi breath, alternate nostril breathing and
          shining skull breath. He knows how to use the inhales to find
          lightness and expansion in the body. He knows how to use the exhales
          to find both stability and softness. He is focused on his breath for
          the better part of his practice, using breath to inform movement
          rather than the other way around.
        </p>
        <li><h3>Meditation</h3></li>
        <p>
          The intermediate practitioner is not in it just for sport. She is
          interested in exploring consciousness. She gives time and attention to
          developing a meditation practice. She feels that meditation will
          inform her physical asana practice, will improve her focus and
          concentration, and will affect her general quality of life. Through
          meditation she begins to learn about her particular attachments, fears
          and illusionary ways of thinking. Her meditation practice helps her to
          think, communicate and act with more thoughtfulness and compassion.

        <img src="./img/Garudasana.jpg" alt="Garudasana Image" />
        <p>Garudasana or Eagle Pose is an asana. Sanskrit: गरुडासन; Garuda – Eagle, Asana – Pose; Pronounced As –
        gah-roo-dah-sah-nah

            <br><br>
          Garuda is the Sanskrit term for eagle. Indian mythology suggests that
          Garuda was the king of all birds. This bird not only served as the
          vehicle of Lord Vishnu but was also a frontrunner when it came to
          fighting against demons. Garuda also means devour. Being an old
          representation of the mythical phoenix, they say that the Garuda
          identifies itself with the “all-consuming fire of the sun’s rays”.
        </p>
        <h4>About The Pose:</h4>
        <p>
          Garudasana or the Eagle Pose is named after Garuda, the king of birds
          in the Indian mythology. This Vinyasa yoga asana is a standing pose
          and works best when practiced in the morning on an empty stomach. Hold
          it for 15-30 seconds.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>What You Must Know Before You Do The Asana</h3>
        <p>This asana must be done only on an empty stomach. You need to make sure to have your meals four to six hours before your
        practice and give your body enough time to digest your food. Ideally, there needs to be a 10-12 hour gap between your
        meals and your practice, which is why it is best advised to practice this asana early in the morning. However, owing to
        busy schedules, a lot of people find it hard to work out in the morning. Such people may practice yoga in the evening.
        Your bowels also must be clean when you practice this asana.</p>

            <h3>How to do Garudasana:</h3>
            <li>
              Stand erect. Gently bend your right knee, and wrap your left leg
              around your right, such that the knees are stacked over each
              other. Your left foot must touch your right shin.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              Raise your arms to the shoulder height and wrap your right hand
              around your left. Ensure that your elbows are bent at 90-degree
              angles and are also stacked.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              Strike a balance in the pose as you gently bring down your hips.
              Your knees must move towards the midline instead of leaning to one
              side.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              Hold the pose for a few seconds. Breathe deeply and slowly. Focus
              on the third eye, and let go of your negative emotions.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>Release the pose, switch the limbs, and repeat the pose.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <h4>Benefits:</h4>
        <p>
          Garudasana helps balance your body. It strengthens your leg muscles
          and lessens sciatica and rheumatism. The pose loosens your legs and
          makes them flexible.
        </p>
        <br /><br /><br />
        <strong
          ><li><h2>Utkatasana (Chair Pose)</h2></li></strong

        <img src="./img/Utkatasana.jpg.webp" alt="" />
        <br />
        <p>
          Utkatasana, Chair Pose, Fierce Pose, Hazardous Pose, Lightning Bolt
          Pose, Wild Pose, or in Bikram Yoga, Awkward Pose, is an asana.
          Sanskrit: उत्कटासन; Utkat – Wild/Fierce, Asana – Pose; Pronounced As –
          OOT-kah-TAHS-anna <br /><br />
          How easy it is to sit on a chair! But when you sit on an imaginary
          chair, it could be quite challenging. This asana is all about sitting
          on that imaginary chair. Utkatasana translates into an intense or
          powerful pose. This asana is also called the Chair Pose, the Powerful
          Pose, the Awkward Pose, and the Fierce Pose.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h4>About the Pose</h4>
        <p>
          Utkatasana or the Chair Pose is like sitting on a chair, except that
          there is no chair. It is not as easy and simple as sitting on an
          actual chair. The pose is a Vinyasa yoga asana. Practice it on an
          empty stomach and hold it for 30 to 60 seconds.
        </p>
        <h4>What You Must Know Before You Do The Asana</h4>
        <p>You must make sure to keep your stomach and bowels empty before you practice this asana. Have your meals at least four
        to six hours before you do the asana so that your food gets digested, and there is enough energy for you to expend
        during the practice.
        
        It is best to practice yoga first thing in the morning. But in the event you cannot work out in the morning, it is
        alright to practice it in the evening.

            <h3>How To Do Utkatasana:</h3>
            <li>Stand straight on your mat and place your feet slightly apart.</li>
            <li>Stretch your arms forward, ensuring that your palms are facing downwards. Your arms must be straight, and you must make
            sure not to bend your elbows.</li>
            <li>Gently bend your knees and push down your pelvis, such that it seems like you are seated in an imaginary chair.</li>
            <li>Make yourself comfortable. To engage better in the pose, imagine reading a newspaper as you hold the pose. And as you do
            that, you must make sure that your hands are parallel to the floor.</li>
            <li>Be aware as you hold the pose, and keep your spine lengthened. Calm your mind and relax. Smile. Now hold the pose for up
            to a minute.</li>
            <li>Gently go down and sit in Sukhasana.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <h4>Benefits:</h4>
        <p>Utkatasana strengthens your lower back, torso, and calves and stretches your chest. The pose stimulates your heart and
        tones your knee muscles.</p>
        <br><br>
        <strong><li><h2>Dhanurasana (Bow Pose)</h2></li>
        </strong>
        <img src="./img/Dhanurasana.jpg.webp" alt="">
        <p>Sanskrit: धनुरासन; Dhanur – Bow, Asana – Pose; Pronounced As dah-noo-rah-sah-nah
        <br><br>
        Dhanurasana or the Bow Pose is one of the 12 basic Hatha Yoga poses. It is also one of the three main back stretching
        exercises. It gives the entire back a good stretch, thus imparting flexibility as well as strength to the back.</p>
        <h4>About The Pose:</h4>
        <p>Dhanurasana or the Bow Pose is named so because it resembles a stringed bow. It is a good back bend and works great when
        you practice it in the morning on an empty stomach. Dhanurasana is a Vinyasa yoga asana. Hold it for 15 to 30 seconds.</p>
        <h4>What You Must Know Before You Do The Asana</h4>
        <p>You must make sure to keep your stomach and bowels empty before you practice this asana. Have your meals at least four
        to six hours before you do the asana so that your food gets digested, and there is enough energy for you to expand
        during the practice.
        <br><br>
        It is best to practice yoga first thing in the morning. But in the event you cannot work out in the morning, it is
        alright to practice it in the evening.</p>

                <li>Lie flat on your stomach, keeping your feet hip-width apart and your arms beside your body.</li>
                <li>Now, gently fold your knees and hold your ankles.</li>
                <li>Inhale, and lift your chest and legs off the ground. Pull your legs back.</li>
                <li>Look straight and keep your face stress-free. A smile should help.</li>
                <li>Hold the pose as you concentrate on breathing. Your body should be as taut as a bow.</li>
                <li>As you get comfortable in the pose, breathe long and deep.</li>
                <li>About 15-20 seconds later, exhale and release the pose.</li>
           </ul>
        </div>
