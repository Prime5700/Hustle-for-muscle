<h1>WHY MENTAL FITNESS</h1>
<img src="startingmental.png">
<p>Physical fitness gets plenty of attention, and for good reason. A healthy body can prevent conditions such as heart disease and diabetes, and help you maintain independence as you age.

        Mental fitness is just as important as physical fitness, and shouldn't be neglected. Including mental dexterity exercises into your daily routine can help you reap the benefits of a sharper mind and a healthier body for years to come.
        
        Mental fitness means keeping your brain and emotional health in tip-top shape. It doesn't mean training for "brain Olympics" or acing an IQ test. It refers to a series of exercises that help you:</p>

        <li>slow down</li>
        <li>decompress</li>
        <li>boost a flagging memory</li>
        <h1>The Importance of Mental Fitness</h1>
        <h2>Mind-body connection</h2>
        <p> It's no surprise that the more you help your body, the more you help your mind. Physical activity increases the flow of oxygen to your brain. It also increases the amount of endorphins, the "feel-good" chemicals, in your brain. For this reason, it's not surprising that people who are in good physical shape also tend to enjoy a higher level of mental agility.</p>
           <p>Engaging in a vigorous physical workout can help you battle depression and gain a more positive outlook on life. Itâ€™s also a great way to beat stress.
           While exercise is good for the brain and the body, so is meditation. Meditation, in conjunction with other methods, is an alternative way to treat depression. Calming the mind allows you to problem solve in a more relaxed way.</p>
        <h2>Benefits of mental fitness</h2>
        <p>When you go to bed after a long day, your body begins to relax. But the mind doesn't always follow.</p>
        <p>Visualization can help. You can often achieve a sense of peacefulness through imagery, the process of picturing a tranquil scene or location. This practice can reduce tension in both your body and your mind by challenging neurons in the less-dominant area of your brain. </p>   
        <p>The less-dominant side of your brain is the area that controls feelings of self-confidence and optimism. When you think about something other than your daily worries, you increase activity in the neural structures of that area of your brain. </p>
        <p>Therefore, visualization can boost your emotional well-being and calm you down mentally.</p>
