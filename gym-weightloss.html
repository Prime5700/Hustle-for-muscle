      <h2 style="font-size: 50px; color: crimson;" id="abc">SCIENCE OF WEIGHT LOSS</h2>
      <p>Fat's use in the body is to provide insulation and cushioning for your internal organs to help regulate body temperature, and for storing energy for later. </p>
      <p>If you are weight training then your body tends to deplet the fat stores </p>
      <p>Muscles take more energy to maintain than your fat cells, so it's recommended that you exercise and build up muscles all over your body to use some extra energy. 
            Cardio can tap into your fat stores and burn off a lot of calories on the spot, so people like to do this as well.
            
            But the reality is, all you need to do is eat less than you're burning, not a lot less, just enough, and you'll shrink those fat stores.
            </p>
        <p>Eating a balanced diet is highly recommended but with high quantity of proteins,vitamins and minerals [Avoid fat as much as possible]</p>
        <p>Insulin converts excess food into fat. When there is insulin fat cannot be reconverted. When you eat now and again, there will be insulin always and you will not be using fat. If you eat lot of simple carbs there will be lot of insulin and it will convert carbs into fat and there will be shortage of carbs and you have to eat again just to live.</p>
        <h3 style="font-size: 50px; color: crimson;" id="def">HOW TO DO</h3>
        <p>In order to loose weight</p>
        <ul>
                <li>Perform exercise of a particular part of body only once in a week </li>
                <li>Perform 4 sets of 20 to 25 repetitions on a very light weight</li>
                <li>Dont forget to do cardio and running for 35 minutes combined</li>
                <li>Stick to light weight training for a good period of time</li>
            </ul>
        <h3 style="font-size: 50px; color: crimson;" id="ghi" >DIETARY PLANS</h3>
        <li>Start your day by drinking 2 medium size glass of luke warm water mix with honey</li>
        <li>Try to eat every 3 times in a day only</li>
        <li>Eat curd,eggs,supplements or wheat breads in breakfast</li>
        <li>Prefer salads,sprouts,wheat breads and any other low calorie food in your lunch</li>
        <li>You may switch to a premium quality Fat burner as a supplement</li>
        <li>Eat vegetables stuffed sandwich in your post lunch</li>
        <li>Eat only high protein quantity stuffs just after gym</li>
        <li>Eat low carbs and high protein dinner [avoid rice and breads]</li>
        <li>Eat anything of your likes and dislikes but stick to load 1600 calories a day [ carbs and protein contain 4 calories whereas fat contain 9 calories in a gram]</li>
        <li>Therefore if you eat 10 grams of crabs and 10 grams of protein and 10 grams of fat than it will provide you with 170 calories</li>   
        <p>"Eat nothing and burn fat" is a myth it is highly advised to eat decent quantity of carbs [eating carbs will keep you energetic] as they the source of energy, first 20 to 25 minutes will consume your entire energy and then afterwards the entire sessions will burn fat cells</p>
