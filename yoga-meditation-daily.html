    <h2>Right Type Of Meditation For You</h2>
    <p>
      Despite appearances, the act of meditation is more than simply sitting in
      silence for a period of time. It is the beginning of a journey into the
      inner depths of your heart and mind. It is through the exploration of
      these depths where we tap into our true desires and develop an
      understanding of who we are and what unique talents and gifts we can bring
      to the world. Though, at some point in one’s meditation journey we may ask
      the question, "What meditation style is really best for me?"
      <br />
      <br />
      Meditation has the potential to offer some wondrous benefits, but it can
      be overwhelming to choose a style. Thanks to its popularity, there are
      many options to choose from and the internet has a lot to say about the
      topic. If you’re curious, the best thing to do is to start trying
      different ones. You will notice some people are comfortable with one
      meditation style and others like to experiment with different ones, and
      that’s perfectly fine. It’s important to find one that suits you and
      supports where you’re at in life.
    </p>
    <h2>The Gifts of Meditation</h2>
    <p>
      As human beings, we are in constant flux, as is everything around us. Like
      the ebb and flow of ocean tides, you may go through periods where you
      might need to make some adjustments to get back into “the flow” of your
      own rhythm. One of the greatest gifts of meditation is learning how to be
      flexible, and this becomes especially important when it comes to your
      meditation practice. Choosing a meditation style should be stress free,
      though it can be discouraging if you aren’t feeling the results you are
      expecting. Another important lesson of meditation is the concept of
      letting go of expectations. <br />
      <br />
      There isn’t a meditation that works better than another. They all offer
      their own unique benefits and each person’s experience varies as well.
      Depending on what’s going on in life, sometimes you may need more guidance
      to help focus or maybe you just want to feel happier. It’s helpful to get
      in the habit of noticing your rhythms and how you are doing mentally,
      physically, and spiritually, and then making adjustments. These
      adjustments can be as big as quitting a job that is unfulfilling or as
      small as saying thank you more often. Meditation helps you to know what it
      is you need to do to enrich your life.
    </p>
    <h2>Meditation Self-Assessment</h2>
    <p>
      First, it’s important to first check-in with yourself and do a quick
      assessment. Feel free to jot down your responses.
    </p>
    <div class="ul">
      <ul>
        <li>What do you feel is lacking in your life?</li>
        <li>
          How does your body feel? Are there any places where it feels heavy or
          stuck?
        </li>
        <li>Do you have a lot on your mind, more than usual?</li>
        <li>Do you need help focusing?</li>
        <li>
          How do you want to feel? Nourished, connected, energized, purposeful,
          etc.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <p>
      Don’t limit yourself to these questions. If something else keeps coming to
      mind, take notice of it. Your responses to these questions will be helpful
      in determining which style of meditation you might like to try. Use this
      only as a guide and remember that you will receive benefits from every
      meditation, perhaps in some unexpected ways. Meditation is always there
      for you in whatever way you need it to be. Let’s explore some meditation
      styles and see if there is one that you might like to try!

        <li><h2>Guided Meditation</h2></li>
        <p>
          Guided meditations are great for when you would like to be led through
          an experience. These can be done by going to an in-person class,
          listening to a recording, or following any kind of verbal instruction.
          This style sometimes requires some imagination that comes natural to
          some people. If you’re not one of those people, just do your best and
          play “pretend.” You will still receive the same benefit. The topic or
          theme of the guided meditation can be related to physical well-being,
          manifesting, abundance, etc.

        <p>
          If you want to start changing your perception of the world,
          Loving-Kindness Meditation can begin to help make this shift. It uses
          words, images, and feelings, to invoke qualities of love and
          friendliness toward yourself and others. In recent years, research on
          this particular type of meditation has shown a range of benefits from
          improving general well-being to providing relief from illness and
          increasing social connectedness.

        <li><h2>Mindfulness Meditation</h2></li>
        <p>
          Meditation encompasses a wide range of practices, including eating,
          walking, observing the world, and even the more familiar method of
          sitting in stillness. Mindfulness is one such meditation practice that
          can be life changing. With its roots steeped in the Buddhist
          tradition, mindfulness is an ongoing life practice that helps you to
          accept all that arises without judgement. It addresses what is going
          on in the moment and works to release it right away. You cultivate the
          practice of surrendering and placing attention on that which helps you
          grow and evolve in a positive direction. In the words of spiritual
          leader and Buddhist monk, Thich Nhat Hanh: “Mindfulness helps you to
          go home to the present. And every time you go there and recognize a
          condition of happiness that you have, happiness comes.”

            <h3>Benefits:</h3>
            <li>Helps to refocus attention</li>
            <li>Decreases stress response</li>
            <li>Helps shift toward a positive mood</li>
            <li>Enhances self-awareness</li>
            <li>Improves health and well-being</li>
            </ul>
            <p>There are many ways to practice mindfulness, including just taking moments throughout the day to notice how you feel and
            what’s going on around you. To help you get started, this quick meditation technique called “S.T.OP.” can help you deal
            with stressful moments. It allows you to pause, take in what’s happening, and then act with more awareness and wisdom.

          <li><h2>Mantra Meditation</h2></li>
          <p>This is a common and beloved meditation practice that tends to be more structured. The word “mantra” means vehicle or
          instrument of the mind and can be used in different ways. Mantras can be sounds, words, or phrases and are often
          silently repeated for the duration of a meditation, helping keep the mind focused and serving as a vehicle to reach
          higher states of consciousness. Some mantras are meant to have meaning and others are used for their sounds or
          vibrations and purposefully have no meaning.</p>
          <ul>
            <h3>Benefits:</h3>
            <li>Satisfies a need for structure</li>
            <li>Focuses the wandering mind</li>
            <li>Reduces stress</li>
            <li>Improves mental and physical health</li>
            <li>Helps to gain clarity into your true desires</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Once you start researching mantras, you will find that there are many available. Mantra meditation is best learned from
          a qualified teacher, such as those certified through the Chopra Center where Primordial Sound Meditation is taught. You
          can also do a search for teachers in your area. There are different techniques available to learn; feel free to try them
          all or stick to whichever one you enjoy practicing.</p>

          <li><h2>Breathing</h2></li>
          <p>You may tend to spend a lot of time thinking about the past or the future while ignoring the most important moment: “the
          now” or “the present.” You don’t have control over changing the past or future, but you do have control over the
          present. What you do today affects tomorrow.
          
          The practice of a breathing meditation can help you bring your focus back into the present moment so that you can make
          more conscious decisions. The benefits are often felt immediately as the mind-body connection becomes established. As
          the mind calms, so does the body and vice versa. A breathing meditation or practice can help you to understand and
          appreciate how you can influence your own physical and mental well-being.</p>
          <ul>
            <h3>Benefits:</h3>
            <li>Reduces stress immediately</li>
            <li>Helps to ground</li>
            <li>Clears and centers the mind</li>
            <li>Revitalizes the body</li>
            <li>Improves physical well-being</li>
          </ul>
          <p>You can learn more about breathing techniques from yoga studios or wellness centers in your area. Also, the internet
          provides a great deal of tutorials.
          
          A breathing practice that can be very calming is called Nadi Shodhana. You can perform this anywhere and anytime you
          begin to feel some stress. In general, it’s helpful to start with a breathing practice before going into your regular
          meditation.</p>
